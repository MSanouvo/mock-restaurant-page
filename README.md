# mock-restaurant-page
A small project learning how to use Webpack for future projects.

The page itself is very barebone as I wanted to learn more about creating projects using Webpack. There is a lot more that could be done such as add more menu items and make the texts more descriptive, but since I don't have any real content to go with, I'd rather leave it as is - this is just a mock up anyways. At the very least, this project can serve as a template for future websites that may have a similar layout.
